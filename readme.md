#Angular Token Fields

<!--[Demo](http://www.pocketconfetti.com/token-fields "Token Fields Demo")-->

Not a plugin, just a component used in an application.

This token field directive was modeled after entering email addresses in gmail. It assumes an array of existing "tokens" to search through and add to. The user can enter any string wanted and press either comma or enter to create it. A suggestive search dropdown is displayed that is filtered as the user types more characters. If an existing token is typed and attempted to be made into a token, an event is triggered. The demo simply displays an alert, but custom messaging or interactions can be wired in there.
